* ok now ,discuss all the git commands
git init-- Initialize a local Git Repository
git add/git add . -- Add one or more files to staging area
git commit -m "message" -- Commit changes to head but not to the remote repo(store in local repo)
git status-- Check the current repo and list the files you have changed
git log --provides a list of all the commits made on your branch
git branch -- display all your branch name
git branch <name> -- create new branch
git checkout <branch name> -- switch a branch into the active branch
git merge--
git rebase--
git diff--It will display all the works done in the branch with data 
* commands for remote Repository
git push -u origin <branch name> -- push all the files and folder in the remote repo of your branch
git remote add origin <server url> -- One time activity of one remote repostiory 
git config -global user.name "name"-- configure the name of your remote repo

ok now explor something funny thing about git

now copy this url and paste it on your browser
https://github.com/Warzon-ops/git-class

ok any doubt up to now nothing , are u sure? yeah what you did now I practice it yesterday 
, only add the files into the remote repo right na? yeah 
ok r u understand this image 
what is staging area?
 now we have 2 files, now the files are modified and untracked stage means the files are not add yet, right yeah
 ok when you add the file the files are ready to be commit but not commited, this situation files and folder are in staged area
 after you commit the files and folder, it goes to local repository means(. git )
 means new -item command(only used for windows powershell not for git) 
 create files in the folder but not add it so we have to add them ok

ok now you something know about git, right yup

scenario -1
-----------

you are a game devloper..
you have to write your own code for company project...
(After this line we are created a new branch game-rs ,)
In company policy ,they have a central repository(e.g git, git lab, svn etc)..
also they have multiple branches for different work and different project 

can you please explain me a little in voice im a bit confuse if possible 
no its not possible sorry ok ok
If you r confusing then we can stop it here 
yeah its confusing a little 
actualy when you pull it you take it out from remote to local repo right?

ok see carefully
when i pull the repository it upadte the local version of this repository from a remote

means we have two branches ok master,and game-rs (forget other branch)
some files are in master 
ok
ok
then we create 2 files in game-rs (file1.txt ,file2.txt) ok
ok
then we want these files are need to add on our remote repostiory but
 not in master branch
 ok so we pull it and again after adding it to other brach(game-rs) we push it back
 ok so when ever we have to create files to a branch of our own we pull it from remote repo and again push it back

 see github doesnot know about your local repo and your working branch yeah

now ur doubt is clear or something

without performing pull , cant we simply create a branch 
add the files and push it to remote repo


is pulling necessary in this case
 ofcourse it's necessary for now ,you have to aware of this ok
the stuff is going to be complecated day by day
hm i can feel that

ok one last two thing for to day 
 if i type git diff in my working directory in game-rs branch
-- It will display all the works done in the branch with data

ok clear yeah

ok now one last command 
we have two branch master and game-rs 
and also we have  another branch main which not used yet 

have u seen the difference yeah
ok now
any question?
no
